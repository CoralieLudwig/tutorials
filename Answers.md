Below are answers on the questions raised during the tutorials. They are in no way exhaustive and unique, many questions do not actually have a clear answer.

## Proteomics Data

The gaps correspond to acquisition time where the instrument is not measuring MS1 spectra. For example, the instrument can be fragmenting or acquiring MSn spectra.


#### :thought_balloon:2

In a proteomics sample, we expect peaks in MS1 to be the detection of ionized peptides. In MS2, we expect peaks to be the product of the fragmentation of peptides, i.e. fragment ions. Note however that while the mass spectrometer is tuned to target peptides and peptide fragments, other species can be recorded, like small molecules, sugars, or lipids.
