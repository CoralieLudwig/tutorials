# Proteomics data

In this tutorial, navigate proteomics data at various stages of a quantitative proteomic analysis.

## Raw data

Raw proteomics data consist of multiple mass spectrometry runs, each corresponding to the acquisition of a sample. A sample can be spread across multiple runs, which is referred to as _sample fractionation_.

## Format and tools

Mass spectrometers produce raw data in various formats which are not necessarily open. These formats can be converted to mzML, the reference standard for mass spectrometry files [(1)](#references). The reference tool to process raw files is Proteowizzard [(2)](#references), it allows navigating and converting most mass spectrometry formats.

. Install [Proteowizzard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/)
