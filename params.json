Just like you need to adapt your protocol to your sample, there is not a one workflow fits all when it comes to data interpretation. The scripts proposed here are not to be blindly copy-pasted, but aim at introducing basic methods. You can use some of the tutorials as cheat sheet when developing your own scripts.\r\n\r\nThe tutorials are provided without guarantee using simple example datasets. Hopefully you will find them useful. If you have suggestions and comments, please post them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mvaudel/tutorials/issues). I will extend the tutorials according to your feedback.\r\n\r\n## Visualization of Expression Values\r\n\r\nThis short [tutorial](https://github.com/mvaudel/tutorials/blob/master/Visualization/data_visualization.md) shows how to make a Figure displaying expression profiles under different conditions for different groups. This will get you rid of ugly bar plots. See example below.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](Visualization/data_visualization_files/figure-markdown_github/chicken_box_plot_median_2-1.png)\r\n\r\n_Plotting expression values with a bar plot is hurting your data._\r\n\r\n## Genome Wide Association\r\n\r\nThis short [tutorial](https://github.com/mvaudel/tutorials/blob/master/Genome_Association/genome_association.md) shows how to draw some plots used in genome wide association.\r\n\r\n![](Genome_Association/genome_association_files/figure-markdown_github/manhattan_plot-1.png)\r\n\r\n## Analysis of Expression Data\r\n\r\nThis [tutorial](https://github.com/mvaudel/tutorials/blob/master/Expression_data/quantitative_proteomics.md) shows basic methods and visualization techniques for the interpretation of expression data using an example from quantitative proteomics.\r\n\r\n![](Expression_data/quantitative_proteomics_files/figure-markdown_github/volcano_plot-1.png)\r\n",
